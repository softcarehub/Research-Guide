> # Machine Learning
## Types of Machine Learning
1. Classical Machine Learning
2. Deep Learning(complex than classical machine learning)

## Requirements
1. Minimum one programming language(Python) [Learn-Python](https://learn-python.org)
2. Anaconda(Python and machine learning all packages are available within this software package) 
or google Colab
- jupiter notebook(write code) & other libraries required for machine learning
- Library Machine Learning{ 
    `pandas`(data processing:used for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.)
    `scikit_learn`(algorithms accessible:It provides a wide range of machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and more.)
    `numpy`  for numerical computing in Python
    }
- For deep learning(`TensorFlow`,`Keras`: there have library in anaconda for combined this two)
3. Dataset
- Resource: [kaggle.com](http://kaggle.com)

## Learning Resources
1. Book
- `Machine Learning:` [cookbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bF1zRPvH18sGKJuDBlkaSVuT0siigj-K/view?usp=sharing) by using this book learn how to  train data model by python language
[Absolute Beginners](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oy6AmdT8OgxZUYSd2P5uWOHuTV0njIPZ/view?usp=sharing) by using this book learn the basics concept of model
- `Deep learning:` [Ian Goodfellow](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZZxfvXZoVRBJc8rqmH2pUjg8G9cWiYox/view?usp=sharing) A to Z for Deep Learning
2. Tutorial 
3. Online Course
- Coursera course:[Andrew Ng](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/) this is his website for courses 


## flower detection
1. Features selection so that we can distinguish between two flower
2. 

# Classical Machine Learning
- Three types of Machine Learning
1. `Supervised Learning`
- Level required(output): Level means what we are going to predict that we know the value
- classification, regression problem
- Develop predictive model based on both input and output data
2. `Unsupervised Learning`
- Not Level required(output)
- clustering
- If there don't have level then it will be unsupervised learning
- Group and interpret data based only on input data
3. `Reinforcement Learning`
- first learn then take action
