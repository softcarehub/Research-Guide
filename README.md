# Machine Learning
## Types of Machine Learning
1. Classical Machine Learning
2. Deep Learning(complex than classical machine learning)

## Requirements
1. Minimum one programming language(Python) [Learn-Python](https://learn-python.org)
2. Anaconda(Python and machine learning all packages are available within this software package)
- jupiter notebook(write code) & other libraries required for machine learning
- Library Machine Learning{ 
    `pandas`(data processing:used for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.)
    `scikit_learn`(algorithms accessible:It provides a wide range of machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and more.) 
    }
- For deep learning(TensorFlow,Keras: there have library in anaconda for combined this two)
