## Ensemble methods in machine learning
### What is Ensemble method?
- [read more](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/data-science/ensemble-methods/)
- Ensemble methods are techniques that aim at improving the accuracy of results in models by combining multiple models instead of using a single model.
- ![What's SVM?](images/ensemble1.png)
- ![What's SVM?](images/ensemble.png)
- `combine multiple models` (holding with best accuracy not like it) to improve the accuracy of results. 
- In ensemble methods in machine learning, the idea is to combine multiple models to improve overall predictive performance. Ensemble methods can be broadly categorized into two types: bagging and boosting. Ensemble learning helps improve machine learning results by combining several models. This approach allows the production of better predictive performance compared to a single model. Basic idea is to learn a set of classifiers (experts) and to allow them to vote. Advantage : Improvement in predictive accuracy.
### Example of some ensemble methods:
  - `Bagging:` Reduces variance and prevents over fitting
     - In bagging, multiple instances of the same base model are trained independently on different subsets of the training data (usually sampled with replacement).
     - Examples include Random Forest, Bagged Decision Trees.
  - `Stacking:` Builds a new model based on the combined output of multiple models
     - ![What's SVM?](images/stacking.png)
     - Idea: Stacking, also known as Stacked Generalization, involves training a meta-model that combines the predictions of multiple base models. The base models are trained independently, and their outputs serve as input features for the meta-model.
     - Process:Train multiple diverse base models on the training data. Use the predictions of these base models as input features for a higher-level model (meta-model). The meta-model learns to combine the predictions of base models to make the final prediction.
  - `Boosting:` Reduces bias
     - Boosting algorithms train a series of weak learners sequentially, with each learner trying to correct the errors of its predecessor.
     - Examples include AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM.
  - `Gradient Boosting:` Improves each weak learner
     - Idea: Gradient Boosting is an ensemble technique where weak learners (usually decision trees) are trained sequentially. Each new tree corrects the errors of the combined ensemble.
     - Process: Train a weak learner (tree) on the data. Compute the errors made by the ensemble so far. Build a new weak learner to correct these errors. Repeat until a predefined number of weak learners is reached. Examples: XGBoost, LightGBM, AdaBoost with decision trees.
  - `AdaBoost:Adaptive Boosting` Reassigns weights to each instance, with higher weights for misclassified instances
     - Idea: AdaBoost is a boosting algorithm that assigns weights to the observations. It focuses on the mistakes made by the previous models and gives higher weights to misclassified data points.
     - Process:Train a weak learner.Increase the weights of misclassified observations.Train another weak learner with updated weights.Repeat until a predefined number of weak learners is reached. Combine the weak learners into a strong model.
     - Adaboost falls under the supervised learning branch of machine learning. This means that the training data must have a target variable. Using the adaboost learning technique, we can solve both classification and regression problems.
     - Example: AdaBoost with decision trees.
  - `Voting:` Trains multiple model algorithms and makes them "vote" during the prediction phase
     - Idea: Voting, or Majority Voting, combines predictions from multiple models and selects the class that receives the majority of votes.
     - Process: Train multiple diverse base models independently. When making predictions, each model votes for a class.The class with the majority of votes is the final prediction.
     - Types: Hard Voting: Each model contributes one vote. Soft Voting: Models provide probabilities, and the class with the highest average probability is selected. Example: sklearn's VotingClassifier.
-  Other ensemble methods include: Bootstrapping, Heterogeneous ensemble. When choosing between these methods, consider the characteristics of your data and the problem at hand. Stacking requires more computation but often leads to improved performance. Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost are effective for handling weak learners, and Voting is a simple yet powerful ensemble method. Experimenting with different approaches is key to finding the best ensemble strategy for a particular problem.
### why AdaBoost is considered an ensemble method?
- `Multiple Weak Learners:` AdaBoost doesn't use just one decision tree; it uses multiple weak learners (decision trees). Each weak learner is trained sequentially, and its performance is weighted based on the errors made by the previous learners. Weak learners are used in ensemble methods, where multiple weak learners are combined to create a strong learner that can make more accurate predictions.
### When and How choosing models for ensemble method?
- `Introduction:` it's common to use diverse models that have different strengths and weaknesses. The idea is that errors made by one model might be compensated by another model. Here are some guidelines:
- `Diversity:` The models you choose should be diverse, i.e., they should make different types of errors. For example, combining a decision tree with a linear model could be more effective than combining two similar decision trees.
- `Model Types:` You can mix models of different types or architectures. For example, combining a decision tree with a neural network.
- `Hyperparameter Tuning:` Train each base model with different hyperparameters to maximize their individual performance.
- `Avoid Perfect Correlation:` If two models are perfectly correlated (i.e., they make the exact same predictions), ensembling them won't provide much benefit. Diversity is key.
- `Performance Metrics:` Choose models that perform well on the specific metric you care about. If one model is significantly better than others based on the metric of interest, it might make sense to give it more weight in the ensemble.
- `Consider Computation Time:` Ensemble methods can be computationally expensive, especially if you're training a large number of models. Consider the trade-off between computational cost and potential performance improvement.

### Motivation
- Ultimately, the effectiveness of ensembling depends on the dataset, the choice of models, and the specific problem you are trying to solve. It's often a good idea to experiment with different combinations and observe how the ensemble performs on validation or test data.

### Decision Tree:
-  Decision Trees are a versatile and interpretable machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They recursively partition the feature space into subsets based on the values of input features, ultimately leading to a tree-like structure that makes decisions at each internal node.
### Random Forest:
-  Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees during training and merges their predictions to improve accuracy and robustness. It is known for its high predictive performance and ability to handle complex relationships in the data. Diabetes Prediction Models:
- Random Forest:
  - Random Forest is a powerful ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) of the individual trees. This algorithm is particularly suitable for diabetes prediction due to its ability to handle complex relationships within the data. Diabetes is influenced by a myriad of factors, including genetic predisposition, lifestyle, and environmental factors. The Random Forest algorithm excels in capturing these intricate relationships by creating a diverse set of decision trees, each trained on different subsets of the data. This diversity allows the model to generalize well to new, unseen data, making it robust for predicting diabetes across varied patient profiles.

### Adaboost:
-  AdaBoost is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines the predictions of weak learners to create a strong, robust model. It is particularly effective for binary classification problems and is known for its ability to adaptively adjust the weights of misclassified samples during training. 
- Adaboost:
  - Adaboost, short for Adaptive Boosting, is a boosting ensemble algorithm that is well-suited for heart disease prediction due to its adaptability and capacity to enhance model accuracy over successive iterations. Heart disease prediction often involves complex patterns and subtle relationships between various risk factors. Adaboost addresses this challenge by sequentially training multiple weak learners (usually simple decision trees) and assigning higher weights to instances that are misclassified in the previous iteration. This iterative process allows Adaboost to focus more on instances that are difficult to classify, gradually improving the model's overall accuracy. In the context of heart disease, where the identification of nuanced features is crucial, Adaboost's ability to adapt and learn from misclassifications makes it a valuable choice.

### Extra Trees: 
-  Extra Trees is an ensemble learning technique that builds multiple decision trees in an extremely randomized manner. It is similar to Random Forest but introduces additional randomness in the tree-building process, making it computationally efficient and less prone to overfitting. 
### Stacking:
-  Stacking, also known as stacked generalization, is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple diverse models to improve overall predictive performance. It involves training a meta-model that learns how to best combine the predictions of the base models. Stacking aims to leverage the strengths of different models and mitigate their individual weaknesses. 
- Stacking:
   - In the realm of predicting Parkinson's disease, a nuanced and intricate task, the ensemble method of Stacking stands out as a strategic choice. Stacking involves combining the predictive power of various algorithms, namely Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaboost, Gradient Boosting (GB), XGBoost (XGB), and Extra Tree. Each of these algorithms contributes its unique strengths and perspectives to the predictive process.

- The rationale behind using Stacking lies in its ability to leverage the diverse expertise of individual models. Stacking works in two stages: the base models make predictions, and a meta-model combines these predictions to produce the final output. This approach is particularly advantageous for complex tasks like Parkinson's disease prediction, where multiple facets of data need to be considered.

- By combining the predictions of various models, Stacking aims to capture a more comprehensive view of the underlying patterns in Parkinson's-related data. This ensemble method can effectively handle the intricacies of the disease's manifestations, leading to a more accurate and robust predictive model. The amalgamation of different algorithms through Stacking is a strategic approach to enhance the overall performance and reliability of Parkinson's disease prediction.
## 3.4.3 Model Training and Evaluation

Training Process: Random Forest is trained using an ensemble of decision trees. Each tree is constructed by considering a random subset of features and data points, ensuring diversity.
Hyperparameters: Key hyperparameters include the number of trees, maximum depth of trees, and the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.
Optimization Techniques: The model optimizes its performance through techniques like bootstrapping (random sampling with replacement) and feature randomness.
Support Vector Machine (SVM):
Training Process: SVM is trained by finding the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the high-dimensional feature space.
Hyperparameters: Key hyperparameters include the choice of the kernel (linear, polynomial, radial basis function), regularization parameter (C), and kernel-specific parameters.

This comprehensive training and evaluation strategy ensures that each model is optimized, evaluated using appropriate metrics, and validated through rigorous cross-validation, contributing to the reliability of the multi-disease prediction framework.
## 3.4.4  Ensemble Methods
Ensemble methods, a cornerstone in the realm of machine learning, play a pivotal role in enhancing prediction accuracy, especially when dealing with complex tasks like multi-disease prediction. In the specific context of stacking, the process involves a two-step strategy.

Base Models Prediction:

The first step deploys a set of diverse machine learning algorithms, each specializing in its unique way to analyze the data and make predictions. For instance, in our case, algorithms like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaboost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Extra Tree are employed.
Each of these base models independently processes the input data and generates predictions based on its inherent understanding of the underlying patterns.
Meta-Model Integration:

The predictions from the base models are then fed into a meta-model, which acts as a higher-level learning algorithm.
The meta-model learns from the individual predictions of the base models, discerning patterns, relationships, and potential biases in their outputs.
By considering the collective intelligence of the base models, the meta-model produces a final prediction that is often more accurate and robust than the predictions of individual models.
Rationale Behind Ensemble Methods:
Ensemble methods, such as stacking, capitalize on the concept of "wisdom of the crowd." Each base model may have its strengths and weaknesses, and ensemble methods strategically leverage the diverse perspectives of these models to arrive at a more comprehensive and accurate prediction. This approach is especially beneficial when facing challenges such as dataset noise, model bias, or the complexity of the underlying patterns. Ensemble methods contribute to the stability and reliability of predictions, making them a valuable asset in the pursuit of accurate multi-disease prediction.
## 3.4.5 Validation and Generalization 
To ensure the validity and generalization of the predictive models, a thorough validation process is employed. The models are tested on unseen data, simulating real-world scenarios. K-fold cross-validation is crucial in this phase, as it assesses model performance across different subsets of the data, reducing the risk of bias introduced by specific data splits. The choice of k (number of folds) is influenced by the dataset's size and characteristics. Additionally, attention is given to potential overfitting, ensuring that the models generalize well to diverse patient populations and healthcare settings. This comprehensive validation strategy aims to provide confidence in the models' ability to make accurate predictions beyond the training data, emphasizing their practical utility in real-world healthcare applications.
