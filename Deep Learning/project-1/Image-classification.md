- Title: Image Classification Project in Python | Deep Learning Neural Network Model Project in Python
## Explain models: 
![neural network model](images/1model-Neural%20network.png)
- Image classification network with the help of the TensorFlow keras
- `TensorFlow` is an open-source library developed by Google primarily for deep learning applications. It also supports traditional machine learning
- Every model needs the `training dataset & test dataset` in addition to that this tensorflow model which we are going to build here is sequential model.
- For this one we are going to give another dataset which is called the `validation dataset`
- so why we are giving this` validation dataset` is sometimes  what will happen when we train the model on the training dataset it will be fitting the only particularly based upon the values and the training dataset in real time it may not give the accurate results because the training dataset and real dataset might get differ.
- So our model completely relies upon the training dataset
- So to avoid this issue in real time what we are doing here is we are caring another dataset which is called the validation dataset 
- so here we are giving the validation dataset as well as to the model when it is getting trained 
- so what exactly happens is when model is getting trained based upon the training dataset at each and every step It will validate its results.
- Again its validation dataset as well 
- so that our model accuracy will be increased when the model is created itself.
- so that will give the highly accurate results in the real time 
- So once we trained our model then we will be doing the testing so testing will be done  with the completely new images which we found it in the Google here.
- so we will try we will test our model with the google images
- So once we do the testing of our model then we will be deploying it as a web application as I seen the earlier video.
- Now lets start with coding for project.

## Preprocessing Data & ready the dataset
- opening Jupiter Lab
- two libraries need install in system: pip install tensorflow streamlit matplot numpy pandas

## model creation
- 

## Predicting values from model
- 

## Deploying as web App
